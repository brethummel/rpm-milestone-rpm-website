Description
======================

The Hero module is intended to be used at the top of a page or post. There are three styles.

Marquee
----------------------
This is a singular large, billboard-style hero image. The background can either be an image or a video. Settings include text orientation and whether or not to include up to two buttons.

Page Header
----------------------
This is a shorter hero "strip" that can be used at the top of secondary pages. The background is always an image. Settings include text orientation and whether or not to include up to two buttons.

Carousel
----------------------
This is a carousel version of the Marquee (i.e. a slideshow version of the large, billboard-style hero image), except the background is limited to always being an image. Settings include text orientation and whether or not to include up to two buttons and a slide by slide basis.
